            <p>It is a home away from home! A place where you can relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and the stressors that come with it. Imagine waking up to birds chirping and sun beaming down on you. Eating breakfast on the deck, looking out to the beach. Bonfires and s'mores after a long day of swimming and sunbathing. Here you will learn about cottage living and all it has to offer!</p>

            <p>It's true that the weather can't always be perfect, but don't let that stop you from enjoying your time at the cottage! Whether it's raining or the sun is beaming down, there are always fun things to do in cottage country. On a hot day, taking a walk down to the beach store to get an ice cream cone is the perfect activity. Going for a swim in light rainshowers is always a blast! Taking a bunch of cozy blankets to the local drive in movie theater or even something as simple as playing a game of cards are great ideas to make your cottage experience a great one.</p>

              <p>From pancakes and bacon to burgers on the BBQ, some of the best foods are eaten at the cottage. There is nothing like a meal of fresh corn on the cob from the local farmer's market and some sausages on the grill acompanied by a beautiful sunset. A sweet treat to top it all off never hurts either!</p>
